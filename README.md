## ‚ùîWhat's This Project All About

This open-source project is about creating a collection of materials that make machine learning accessible to all, with a focus on practical use.

## ‚úÖ Aims

- [ ] Enable developers new to machine learning to:
    - [ ] understand enough ML concepts to practically use it
    - [ ] practically get started with ML

- [ ] Improve accessibility to the topic:
    - [ ] Form a comprehensive basis for an open-source e-book

### How to get involved?
- Comment on an open issue that you wish to contribute to it - it will be assigned to you üôÇ

## üìãQuality
### All Types of Issues
- Where work draws direct inspiration from another work - it must be fully referenced - using the IEEE standard
    - [ ] Help on IEEE to follow soon...
          [IEEE Referencing Style](https://github.com/Ishika414/practical-introduction-to-machine-learning/blob/main/IEEE%20STYLE%20REFERENCING.md)
-  All linked to external resources must be openly available for free

### Code-Based Issues
- [ ] Must run in an interactive python notebook (.ipynb)
- [ ] OR: if no .ipynb:
    - [ ] full code (including setup) must be provided
    - [ ] expected output must be provided

### Documentation-Issues
- (nothing specific yet...)
