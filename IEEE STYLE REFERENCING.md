# **IEEE STYLE REFERENCING**

In the IEEE referencing style, a number [X] is inserted at the point in the writing where you cite another author's work.

At the end of your work, the full reference [X] of the work is provided. 

Citations and their corresponding references are provided in the order they appear throughout the writing.

IEEE in-text citations consist of numbers provided in square brackets, which correspond to the appropriate sources in the reference list at the end of the paper.

The in-text citations numbers begin from [1] and continue in ascending order throughout the text (unless referring to a source already cited)  

Each in-text citation number should be enclosed by square brackets and appear on the text line, inside sentence punctuation, with a space before the bracket, e.g.

Do not mention authors of a source or provide date of publication within the text except in cases where the author’s name is integral to the understanding of the sentence.

Editing the in-text citation numbers may require renumbering the whole reference list. 

Please check that the in-text citation numbers match the reference list numbers.

The typical components of a reference list are laid our below. Each reference entry should generally contain the referencing elements in the following order:

--Citation number, enclosed within square brackets, is aligned along the left margin. The text of the entry is indented 2 or 3 spaces;

--Author(s) name(s): first names’  initials are placed first, followed by last names;

--Title of the article, book chapter, conference paper or report is typed in double quotation marks, with text provided in lower case;

--Book , Journal or Conference Title is typed in italics. Capitalize the first letter of each important word in the title;

--Publication information: City, State (if U.S.) or Country if City is not well known: Publisher Name, Date;

--Page number(s) if applicable, i.e. if you are referencing a book section, a book chapter in an edited book, or an article. Page numbers are cited as p. for a single page or pp. for multiple pages.
